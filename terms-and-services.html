					<h3>1) Buying from this website</h3>
					<p>
						When purchasing from this website, you agree to a certain points to be mentioned further on this page. To make a purchase you simply click the blue button underneath any post on the main page. You will be directed to PayPal where you can purchase a direct download immediately and safely.
						<br>
						<br>
						In case you happen to lose the product you have purchased, you will need to contact me through the form on the <a class="txt_link" href="../shop/contact">contact</a> page. To get access to the file you have lost, you will need to provide the email adress you purchased the item with, if you provide the incorrect email adress, or I am unable to find this email, you will not be eligible to retrieve your item.
						<br>
						<br>
						Did you get any of the products from someone else, provide their email adress so they can get acces to the file again. You will have to work with them to retrieve your item.
						<br>
						<br>
						Note: VAT is not included onsite, but when purchasing you will see the price with VAT included.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>2) Usage of the website</h3>
					<p>
						The usage of the website is straight forward. On the main page you will find all the posts of items that are up for sale. You can navigate through different categories by using the menu in the top right.
						<br>
						These items are for sale and are also considered portfolio items, however a stand-alone website for the portfolio items will be made in the future.
						<br>
						<br>
						Cookies are not known to exist from my own side, however I do not know if GitHub has any cookies running. If anything, I will unable to track anything and the details GitHub might have are inaccessible for me or the user of this website.
						<br>
						When purchasing an item, there might be cookies used by paypal but since this is a third-party link, I have no power nor responsibilities regarding these possible cookies.
						<br>
						As well as not being responsible for cookies from PayPal, I am in no responsibility position about cookies for CognitoForms, possibly used by the form on the contact page.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>3) Usage of the contact form</h3>
					<p>
						The contact form found on the <a class="txt_link" href="../shop/contact">contact</a> page is meant to be used as a way to contact me through a handy third party emailing system. The form is powered by <a class="txt_link" href="https://www.cognitoforms.com/" target="_blank">CognitoForms</a> and you will receive possible emails by them after contacting me. If you think you are recieving phishing emails, contact CognitoForms on their official website. Their website can be found <a class="txt_link" href="https://www.cognitoforms.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
						<br>
						<br>
						Only contact me regarding the options in the subject dropdown list. Spam will not be tolerated, and you will not be answered if you are having issues the next time. Use the contact form what it's meant to be used for and we will be in contact about the subject you contacted me for.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="column">
					<h3>4) 30 Days Warranty rules</h3>
					<p>
						30 Days warranty means the following, if an update happen to be released for an item you purchased within the next 30 days of your purchase. You will be emailed the new version. If after these 30 days an update rolls out, you will not be eligible for said updated version. You will need to purchase the item again.
						<br>
						You can not get back your money unless you can prove to me and to paypal that you received nothing after purchasing or if the link is broken of the item you purchased. You will need to contact me about this using the Pack loss inquiry, provide your email of which you paid with (as I can only see this when you completed the transaction) and you will retrieve the item nontheless.
						<br>
						<br>
						30 Days warranty for collaboration is almost the same. When purchasing a custom made product, you will have 30 days to request small changes to the product without extra costs. However, large updates such as adding a whole new part to the product, or a completely new item to the package, will not be free and you will be charged. As every item is only delivered after complete approval of the customer, updates are rarely needed but you have the rights to request them. There's no guarantee these updates will be executed as they would have to be reviewed first.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>5) Copyright</h3>
					<p>
						Reselling or gifting purchased items is not allowed, may I come across a place where my products are being used without them purchasing the products, actions will be taken. 3D Unity/Unreal Game Assets will not be sold through paypal on this site, only through third-party websites such as the Unity Asset Store.
						<br>
						Custom made products are so unique that when they surface somewhere else than they were meant to be used for, both parties will be contacted for an explanation and possible other actions that may be required. Do not resell or gift paid products as this will only cause more trouble.
						<br>
						<br>
						When purchasing a product you do not purchase copyrights, I still hold the copyrights over all products that are being sold, as well as custom made products, unless discussed otherwise.
